<h4>Miami Marlins and Derek Jeter</h4>
<p>You may find that I am no longer alone in suspecting that Derek Jeter&apos;s involvement with the Miami Marlins is not innocent. Left unchecked, the Marlins will become a glorified minor league affiliate of the New York Yankees.</p>
<p>&quot;It all started when they traded Stanton&quot; they'll say.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is as follows: The Yankees (with Derek Jeter as their agent), via shadow corporations and the questionably real entities of Bruce Sherman and Private Capital Management, have purchased what amounts to a majority stake in the Miami Marlins.</p>
<p>Why is this a problem you ask? Because the integrity of the game is at stake when the richest, most powerful franchise can flaunt their power to use another major league team as a feeder system.</p>
<p>It may &quot;pass the eye test&quot; as the Marlins rebuilding while the Yankees seek post-season success, but the trade of Giancarlo Stanton to the Yankees was only the beginning. Mark my words, in 2021 all the prospects the Marlins have been acquiring will either be panning out and being traded to the Yankees or traded for future prospects to be ultimately utilized in their prime by the Yanks.</p>
<p>It may also be revealed that Derek Jeter has been directly overseeing gross misconduct in the form of genetic alteration of baseball players in Miami for years (all in preparation for the sale). Online records have been erased but some still remember seeing the photos of the dreaded <i>Gincarlu Santon</i>. A failed, escaped, early attempt at the creation of the wonderful (albeit genetically engineered) man we now know as Giancarlo Stanton.</p>
<p>Please spread the word, because nobody will help us in this and Derek will get away with it unless we rise up.</p>
